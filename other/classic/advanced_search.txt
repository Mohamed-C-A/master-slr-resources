Across iterative trials (e.g., variants 7, 8, 9, 10, …), numerous combinations of complex Boolean search strings were tested. However, these advanced queries did not yield the expected level of relevance and retrieval quality that can be achieved with simpler search approaches.

A more effective alternative is to decompose the overarching problem into smaller, clearly scoped sub-topics and to run targeted keyword searches for each sub-topic. This typically produces results that are more closely aligned with the business case than broad, PICOC-inspired Boolean expressions. One key reason is that the focal area—agentic LLM workflows in a concrete enterprise proposal context—is currently emerging and rapidly evolving, while traditional academic indexing systems still provide limited coverage and inconsistent terminology for this topic.

In this setting, AI-assisted research tools—particularly “Deep Research”—can perform better in practice than attempts to capture the domain solely through complex, formally correct Boolean queries. The main value lies in combining both approaches: AI-assisted retrieval to improve coverage and recency, complemented by the classical SLR process (screening, quality assessment, and data extraction) to ensure transparency, traceability, and methodological rigor.
