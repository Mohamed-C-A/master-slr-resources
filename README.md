## Protocol

The file `parsifal_sota_workflow.txt` contains the complete SLR protocol, including:

- PICOC criteria
- Research questions
- Inclusion and exclusion criteria
- Quality assessment checklist with scoring weights
- Search string construction guidance

This protocol was provided as input to all four AI research platforms.

## AI Platform Outputs

Each platform received the identical protocol and returned ranked paper recommendations. The raw outputs are archived without modification. Final study selection was performed by the primary author based on cross-platform comparison and expert assessment of relevance to the research questions.

## Methodology Note

The AI platforms applied the protocol criteria autonomously. Automated quality scores informed but did not determine final inclusion decisions. The decisive criterion was substantive relevance to the research objectives as assessed by the primary author.

## Reproducibility

Other researchers may inspect these materials to:

- Assess the validity of the AI-assisted approach
- Replicate the methodology with the same or similar platforms
- Adapt the protocol to related research domains

Domain-specific scoping decisions (inclusion/exclusion interpretation, relevance judgement) require the researcher's own expertise.
