This repository contains supplementary appendix material for the seminar paper **Agentic AI Systems for Automated Proposal Generation: A Systematic Literature Review**. It documents the LLM-assisted literature retrieval and the subsequent verification steps to support transparency, traceability, and methodological reproducibility.

## What is included

- Screenshots documenting the search process across the selected sources and tools
- Raw result exports and intermediate artifacts
- Screening and quality-assessment evidence (where applicable)
- Additional notes required to interpret the search outputs and decisions

## How this repository relates to the paper

The paper references this repository as an appendix. The materials here provide the underlying evidence for the described AI-assisted search strategy and the final corpus construction.

## Reproducibility and adaptation

The documented workflow can be followed by other researchers as a methodological reference. However, replication in a different domain requires explicit scoping decisions (e.g., what to include/exclude and how to interpret relevance), which depends on the researcher’s domain expertise and research objectives.
